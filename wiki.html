        <h2>Temperature</h2>
        <p>Temperature is a global property that affects the growth of plants. 
            Every crop has an <b>ideal temperature</b> <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Crops</h2>
            <h3>Properties</h3>
                <p>
                    The game contains a myriad of what I call crop properties; these are<br>
                    essentially just factors that can affect a crop in some manner. Examples<br>
                    of these properties include things like temperature, humidity, and sunlight
                    exposure.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, not every crop values the same property equally. For example, say you have<br>
                    two crops which we'll call A and B. Crop A may favour sunlight very highly, i.e. this<br>
                    is important to crop A's growth, however, Crop B may care very little for sunlight and<br>
                    instead is more concerned about temperature. This system allows for crops to thrive in very<br
                    different environments.
