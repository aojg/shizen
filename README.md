* Added some simplistic UI to display properties about the world, e.g. the global temperature and number of entities.
* Planet now changes colour based on the temperature (redder with warmer temperatures, bluer with colder ones).
* Beginning to work on better proper crop property implementation.
* Started developing a wiki explaining aspects of the game, mainly for my own sake.
